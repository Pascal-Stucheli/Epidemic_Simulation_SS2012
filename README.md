# MATLAB FS12 – Research Plan 

Group Name: EpicDemics
Group participants names: Christian Jordi, Yannick Schmid, Pascal Stücheli
Project Title: Epidemic_Simulation_SS2012

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

As mentioned above, with the focus  on stochastics, we wand to investigate the impact of fluctuations on the outcome of a disease. How does the outcome of the disease changes with different simulations? How many people were infected during the simulations? The aim is to answer this question for the different cities we want to simulate. Furthermore, we are interested to see, how the disease spread in terms of means of transport. Additionally, different conditions could be tested (cities vs. villages, city with a dense public transport network vs. city with few public transport).
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
