# MATLAB FS12 – Research Plan 

Group Name: EpicDemics
Group participants names: Christian Jordi, Yannick Schmid, Pascal Stücheli
Project Title: Epidemic_Simulation_SS2012

## General Introduction

We want to simulate an epidemic outbreak. The use of this could be to identify weak spots in traffic and to find key points in fighting the outbreak.   

## The Model

First step would be to create a random network of imaginary cities. We want to use real data from aviation and in a second step from road traffic. This data will be averaged with respect to the two connected cities.
Second step would be to stochasticly simulate the outbreak in a random city. Each city will then be simulated and calculated how many infected die, how many travel and how many infect another person. 
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
