# MATLAB FS12 – Research Plan 

Group Name: EpicDemics
Group participants names: Christian Jordi, Yannick Schmid, Pascal Stücheli
Project Title: Epidemic_Simulation_SS2012

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

Big fluctuations in the speed of the infection caused by the randomness of the model. Faster outbreak if the initial infection was placed in a hub, that had many interconnections with other hubs.


## References 

We would like to try out our own modelling ideas. But we read different papers on this topic for inspiration.
For example:

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
